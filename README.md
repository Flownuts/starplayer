# starplayer
Interactive Animation &amp; Audio player using sprite sheets
Plays animation by reading a 12x12 sprite sheet image (144 images) every 12 seconds
Different sprite sheets & images can be swapped to change the appearance and create a new android app
Uses layers by rendering multiple sprite sheets by rendering a Background sprite, then Props, then Dancer in order from back to front, currently only using 2, but as many as necessary can be used/added
Further development would be to enhance but not make any more complex as to make it easy for animators to create their own sprite sheets and not need to know how to program
Created originally with Eclipse.  Some problems encountered with Android Studio conversion.
Additional files to be added, but main Java code is in src\
